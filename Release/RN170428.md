### Feature updates  
* Added security verification tests (SVTs) for Azure CDN and Redis Cache.  
* Added support for 'Fix Recommendation' feature across all service types. This will help users resolve control failures rapidly. 
* Added support for scanning Cloud Services (classic). (Although the kit is primarily ARM-focused, several teams had requested an SVT for classic Cloud Services.) 
* Enhanced VM SVT to scan a baseline set of controls for Linux VMs. 
* Added support for validating specific controls (by control-id) in SVTs. This allows checking for specific controls such as ‘encryption-at-rest’ across all resources of a specified type. 
* Enhanced the telemetry dashboard with targeted views for BU stakeholders containing more intuitive display charts and metrics. 
 
### Other improvements/bug fixes 
* Completed migration of all DevOps Kit modules to PowerShell 5.0+ class-based design.  
* Fully separated organization-specific configuration settings from control JSONs.  
* Added ability to set level of detail in telemetry (none, anonymous, full) and to separate telemetry by type of event (API v. usage v. control evaluation). 
* Completed security (SDL), privacy and red team penetration testing reviews for the devops kit project. 
* Refactored runtime components to better isolate control evaluation results database. 
* Added ability to 'bootstrap' the DevOps kit for specific environments. 
* Fixed issues in ASC config validation and Forensics module.
