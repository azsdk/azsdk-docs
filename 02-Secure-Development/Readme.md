# Secure Development

![Secure_Development](../Images/Secure_Development.png)

The Secure Development components of the AzSDK enable a developer to build a cloud application with security baked in at every stage from design until integration and deployment through various artifacts, tools and automation. 

The following features are currently included:
1. [Security Verification Tests (SVTs)](Secure_Development_userguide.md) -  Automates verification of majority of AzSDK security controls for common/prominent Azure Services (App Services, Storage, Azure SQL DB, Key Vault, Virtual Machines, etc.)
2. [Security IntelliSense (SecIntel)](Security_IntelliSense_userguide.md) - Augments traditional IntelliSense with secure coding knowhow and offers corrections, tips and guidelines while a developer writes code. The secure coding rules covered vary from Azure PaaS APIs to traditional web application security and crypto. (This will also be enhanced with reusable 'secure' code snippets eventually.)
