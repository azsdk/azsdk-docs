# Getting started with the Secure DevOps Kit for Azure!

If you have just installed the Secure DevOps Kit for Azure (a.k.a. AzSDK) and are not familiar with 
its functionality, then you can get started with the 2 most basic use cases of AzSDK by going through 
the following getting started guides:
- [Scan the security of your subscription](GettingStarted_SubscriptionSecurity.md)
- [Scan the security of your cloud application](GettingStarted_AzureServiceSecurity.md)  

Thereafter, you can explore individual features further using the table of contents below which has 
pointers to full help on individual features by feature area.

> **Note:** If you have not installed the DevOps Kit yet, follow the instructions in the [installation guide](../00a-Setup/Readme.md) and then come back here.

The overall set of features in the Secure DevOps Kit for Azure are organized by the 6 areas as shown 
in the table below:

|Install-AzSDKContinuousAssurance (ICA)|Sets up continuous assurance for a subscription. This creates various artifacts such as resource group, storage account and automation account| Owner on subscription.|
|Install-AzSDKOMSSolution (IOM)|Creates and deploys an OMS view in a subscription that has an OMS workspace. The OMS view provides visibility to application state across dev ops stages. It also creates alerts, common search queries, etc.	|Reader on subscription.|

|Remove-AzSDKSubscriptionSecurity (RSS)|Removes the configuration done via Set-AzSDKSubscriptionSecurity. It invokes the individual remove commands for RBAC, ARM policy, Alerts and ASC.|Owner on subscription.|
|Repair-AzSDKAzureServicesSecurity (FRS)|Fixes the security controls for various Azure resources using the automated fixing scripts generated by running the AzSDK scan command "Get-AzSDKAzureServicesSecurityStatus" with the '-GenerateFixScript' flag.|Contributor on subscription or respective RGs |
|Repair-AzSDKSubscriptionSecurity (FSS)|Fixes the subscription security related controls using the automated fixing scripts generated by running the AzSDK scan command "Get-AzSDKSubscriptionSecurityStatus" with the '-GenerateFixScript' flag.|Contributor on subscription|
|Set-AzSDKAlerts (SAL)|Sets up activity alerts for the subscription. Includes alerts for subscription and resource specific activities. Alerts can be scopes to subscription or RGs.<br>This is internally called by Set-AzSDKSubscriptionSecurity.|Owner on subscription.
|Set-AzSDKARMPolicies (SAP)|Sets up a core set of ARM policies in a subscription.<br>This is internally called by Set-AzSDKSubscriptionSecurity.|Owner on subscription.|
|Set-AzSDKAzureSecurityCenterPolicies (SSC)|Sets up ASC policies and security points of contact. <br>This is internally called by Set-AzSDKSubscriptionSecurity.|Reader on subscription.|

|Set-AzSDKLocalControlTelemetrySettings|The command configures the AzSDK toolkit to send data to the given Applications Insights account from user's machine.|NA|
|Set-AzSDKOMSSettings|Configures AzSDK to send scan results to the provided OMS workspace. Events can be sent to OMS from 'ad hoc'/SDL mode (via this configuration) or from CICD by specifying OMS settings in a variable or from CA by specifying OMS settings in the CA installation command.|Reader on subscription.|
|Set-AzSDKPolicySettings|Configures the server URL that is used by AzSDK to download controls and config JSON. If this is not called, AzSDK runs in an 'org-neutral' mode using a generic policy.
