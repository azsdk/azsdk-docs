## Overview

#### When and why should I setup org policy

When you run any scan command from the AzSDK, it relies on JSON-based policy files to determine various 
parameters that effect the behavior of the command it is about to run. These policy files are downloaded 'on the fly' from a policy 
server. When you run the public version of the toolkit, the policy files are accessed from a CDN endpoint 
that is managed by the AzSDK team. Thus, whenever you run a scan from a vanilla installation, 
AzSDK accesses the CDN endpoint to get the latest policy configuration and runs the scan using 
it. 

The JSON inside the policy files dictate the behavior of the security scan. 
This includes things such as:
 - Which set of controls to evaluate?
 - What control set to use as a baseline?
 - What settings/values to use for individual controls? 
 - What messages to display for recommendations? Etc.


Note that the policy files needed for security scans are downloaded into each PS session for **all** 
AzSDK scenarios. That is, apart from manually-run scans from your desktop, this same behavior happens 
if you include the AzSDK SVTs Release Task in your CICD pipeline or if you setup Continuous Assurance. 
Also, the AzSDK policy files on the CDN are based on what we use internally in Core Services Engineering 
(CSE) at Microsoft. We also keep them up to date from one release to next .

<!--![Org Policy - The big picture](../Images/07_OrgPolicy_Big_Picture.png)-->

<img src="../Images/07_OrgPolicy_Big_Picture.png" width="80%" />


 
 While the out-of-box files on CDN may be good for limited use, in many contexts you may want to "customize" 
the behavior of the security scans for your environment. You may want to do things such as: (a) enable/disable 
some controls, (b) change control settings to better match specific security policies within your org, 
(c) change various messages, (d) add additional filter criteria for certain regulatory requirements that teams 
in your org can leverage, etc. When faced with such a need, you need a way to create and manage 
a dedicated policy endpoint customized to the needs of your environment. The organization policy setup feature 
helps you do that in an automated fashion. 

In this document, we will look at how to setup an organization-specific policy endpoint, how to make changes 
to and manage the policy files and how to accomplish various common org-specific policy/behavior customizations 
for the AzSDK.

#### How does AzSDK use online policy?

Let us look at how policy files are leveraged in a little more detail. 

When you install AzSDK, it downloads the latest AzSDK module from the PS Gallery. Along with this module there
is an *offline* set of policy files that go in a sub-folder under the %userprofile%\documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\AzSDK\<version> folder. 
It also places (or updates) an AzSDKSettings.JSON file in your %LocalAppData%\AzSDK folder. It is this latter 
file that contains the policy endpoint (or policy server) URL that is used by all local commands. 

Whenever any command is run, AzSDK uses the policy server URL to access the policy endpoint. It first downloads 
a 'metadata' file that contains information about what other files are available on the policy server. After 
that, whenever AzSDK needs a specific policy file to actually perform a scan, it loads the local copy of 
the policy file into memory and 'overlays' any settings *if* the corresponding file was also found on the 
server-side. 

It then accesses the policy to download a 'metadata' file that helps it determine the actual policy files list 
that is present on the server. Thereafter, the scan runs by overlaying the settings obtained from the server with 
the ones that are available in the local installation module folder. This means that if there hasn't been anything 
overridden for a specific feature (e.g., Storage), then it won't find a policy file for that listed in the server
 metadata file and the local policy file for that feature will get used. 

The image below shows this flow with inline explanations:

## Setting up org policy

#### What happens during org policy setup?

At a high level, the org policy setup support for AzSDK does the following:
 - Sets up a storage account to hold various policy artifacts in the subscription you want to use for hosting 
your policy endpoint. (This should be a secure, limited-access subscription to be used only for managing your 
org's AzSDK policy.)
 - Uploads the minimum set of policy files required to bootstrap your policy server.
 - Sets up an Application Insights telemetry account in the subscription so as to facilitate visibility of control 
scan/telemetry events in your central subscription. (This is where control 'pass/fail' events will get sent when other 
people in the org start using the version of AzSDK customized for your org.)
 - Creates a special folder (or uses one specified by you) for storing a local copy of all customizations made to policy.
 - Creates an org-specific (customized) installer that others in your org will use to install and configure the AzSDK 
per your org's policy.

Let us now look at the command that will help with the above and a few examples…

#### The org policy setup command (`Install-AzSDKOrganizationPolicy`)

This command helps the central security team of an organization to customize the behavior of various functions
and security controls checked by AzSDK.  

As discussed in previous sections, AzSDK runtime behavior is mainly controlled through JSON-based policy files 
which have a predefined schema. The command helps in creating a policy store and other required components to
host and maintain a custom set of policy files that override the default AzSDK behavior. 

| Parameter| Description | Required? | Default Value | Comments |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |----|---- |
| SubscriptionId | Subscription ID of the Azure subscription in which organization policy  store will be created. | Yes | None | 
|OrgName | The name of your organization. The value will be used to generate names of Azure resources being created as part of policy setup. This should be alphanumeric. | Yes | None |
| DepartmentName | The name of a department in your organization. If provided, this value is concatenated to the org name parameter. This should be alphanumeric. | No | None |
| PolicyFolderPath | The local folder in which the policy files capturing org-specific changes will be stored for reference. This location can be used to manage policy files. | No | User Desktop |
| ResourceGroupLocation | The location in which the Azure resources for hosting the policy will be created. | No | EastUS2 | To obtain valid locations, use Get-AzureRMLocation cmdlet |

#### First-time policy setup - an example
The following example will set up policies for IT department of Contoso organization. 

You must be an 'Owner' or 'Contributor' for the subscription in which you want to host your org's policy artefacts.
Also, make sure that that the org name and dept name are purely alphanumeric and their combined length is less that 19 characters.

```PowerShell
Install-AzSDKOrganizationPolicy -SubscriptionId <SubscriptionId> ` 
           -OrgName "Contoso" ` 
           -DepartmentName "IT" ` 
           -PolicyFolderPath "D:\ContosoPolicies"
```
The execution of command will create following resources in the subscription (if they don't already exist): 
1. Resource Group (AzSDK-Contoso-IT-RG) - AzSDK-\<OrgName>-\<DepartmentName>-RG. 
2. Storage Account (azsdkcontosoitsa) - azsdk\<OrgName>\<DepartmentName>sa.
3. Application Insight (AzSDK-Contoso-IT-AppInsight) - AzSDK-\<OrgName>-\<DepartmentName>-AppInsight. 

It will also create a very basic 'customized' policy involving just a single change (an org-specific message
in AzSdk.json) and upload AzSdk.json, ServerConfigMetadata.json files to the storage account. It will also
upload an org-specific installation script called AzSDK-EasyInstaller.ps1 to another container within the same 
storage account and another file called ScanAgent.ps1 which is used to support the Continuous Assurance feature.

At the end of execution, an 'iwr' command line will be printed to the console. This command leverages the org-specific
installation script from the storage account for installing AzSDK. The org-specific installer will ensure that 
anyone who installs AzSDK using your 'iwr' command not only gets the core AzSDK module but their local installation 
of AzSDK is also configured to use org-specific policy settings (e.g., policy server URL, telemetry key, etc.)

```PowerShell
iwr 'https://azsdkcontosoitsa.blob.core.windows.net/installer/AzSDK-EasyInstaller.ps1' -UseBasicParsing | iex 
```


## Modifying and customizing org policy 

All subsequent runs of the (same) command above will pick up the JSON files from local PolicyFolderPath and upload 
to policy store, provided the values for OrgName and DepartmentName remain unchanged. (This is required
because the command internally evaluates the locations of various artifacts based on these values.) To modify policy
or add more policy customizations, we shall be reusing the same command as used for first-time setup.

> **Note**: ServerConfigMetadata.json and AzSDK-EasyInstaller.ps1 will always get overwritten on the subsequent run of the command. 

	
#### Common scenarios for org policy customization

In this section let us look at typical use cases for org policy customization and how to accomplish them. 
We will cover the following:

1. Changing the default 'Running AzSDK using…' message  
2. Changing a global setting for some control
3. Changing/customizing a server baseline policy set
4. Customizing specific controls for a service SVT (e.g., Storage.json)
   1. Turning controls On/Off
   2. Changing Recommendation Text
   3. Changing Severity, etc.
5. Changing ARM policy/Alerts set (coming soon…)
6. Changing RBAC mandatory/deprecated lists (coming soon…)


> Note: To edit policy JSON files, use a friendly JSON editor such as Visual Studio Code. It will save you lot of
> debugging time by telling you when objects are not well-formed (extra commas, missing curly-braces, etc.)! This
> is key because in a lot of policy customization tasks, you will be taking existing JSON objects and removing
> large parts of them (to only keep the things you want to modify).

The general workflow for all policy changes will be similar and involve the following steps:

 1) Go to the folder you have used (or the org-setup command auto-generated) for your org-customized policies
 2) Make any modifications to existing files (or add additional policy files as required)
 3) Make sure that there's an entry in the ServerConfigMetadata.json file for all the files you have modified
 (Make sure that this entry matches the file names with correct case!)
 4) Run the policy update command to upload all artifacts to the policy server
 5) Test in a fresh PS console that the policy change is in effect. (Policy changes do not require re-installation of AzSDK.)

Note that you can upload policy files from any folder (e.g., a clone of the originally used/created one). It just needs to 
have the same folder structure as the default one generated by the first-time policy setup and you must specify
the folder path using the '-PolicyFolderPath' parameter.

Because policy on the server works using the 'overlay' approach, the corresponding file on the server
only needs to have the specific changes that are required (plus some identifying elements in some cases).

Lastly, note that when making modifications we will **never** edit the files that came with the AzSDK installation. 
We will create copies of the files we wish to edit, place them in our org-policy folder and make requisite
modifications there.

##### a) Changing the default `'Running AzSDK using...'` message
Whenever any user in your org runs an AzSDK command after having installed AzSDK using your org-specific installer, 
they should see a message such as the following (note the 'Contoso-IT') indicating that AzSDK is running using an org-specific policy:

    Running AzSDK cmdlet using Contoso-IT policy

Notice that here, the default (first time) org policy setup injects the 'Contoso-IT' based on the OrgName and
the DeptName that you provided when you setup your org policy server. (When users are running without your 
org policy correctly setup, they will see the 'Running AzSDK cmdlet using generic (org-neutral)
policy' message which comes from the AzSDK public CDN endpoint.)

This message resides in the AzSdk.json policy file on the server and the AzSDK *always* displays the text 
from the server version of this file.

You may want to change this message to something more detailed. (Or even use this as a mechanism to notify all users
within the org about something related to AzSDK that they need to attend to immediately.) 
In this example let us just make a simple change to this message. We will just add '*' characters on either side 
of the 'Contoso-IT' so it stands out a bit.

###### Steps:

 i) Open the AzSdk.json from your local org-policy folder

 ii) Edit the value for "Policy Message" field by adding 3 '*' characters on each side of 'Contoso-IT' as under:
```
    "PolicyMessage" : "Running AzSDK cmdlet using *** Contoso-IT *** policy"
```
 iii) Save the file
 
 iv) Run the policy setup command (the same command you ran for the first time setup)

###### Testing:

The updated policy is now on the policy server. You can ask another person to test this by running any AzSDK cmdlet
(e.g., Get-AzSDKInfo) in a **fresh** PS console. When the command starts, it will show an updated message as in the 
image below:

![Org Policy - Changed Message](../Images/07_OrgPolicy_Chg_Org_Policy_Msg_PS.png) 

This change will be immediately in effect across your organization. Anyone running AzSDK commands (in fresh PS sessions)
should see the new message. 

##### b) Changing a control setting for specific controls 
Let us now change some numeric setting for a control. A typical setting you may want to tweak is the count of
maximum owners/admins for your org's subscriptions that is checked in one of the subscription security controls. (The out-of-box default is 5.)

This setting resides in a file called ControlSettings.json. Because the first-time org policy setup does not
customize anything from this, we will first need to copy this file from the local AzSDK installation.

The local version of this file should be in the following folder:
```PowerShell
    %userprofile%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\AzSDK\<version>\Framework\Configurations\SVT
```

   ![Local AzSDK Policies](../Images/07_OrgPolicy_AzSDK_Local_Policy_Folder.png) 
 
Note that the 'Configurations' folder in the above picture holds all policy files (for all features) of AzSDK. We 
will make copies of files we need to change from here and place the changed versions in the org-policy folder. 
Again, you should **never** edit any file directly in the local installation policy folder of AzSDK. 
Rather, **always** copy the file to your own org-policy folder and edit it there.

###### Steps:

 i) Copy the ControlSettings.json from the AzSDK installation to your org-policy folder
 
 ii) Remove everything except the "NoOfApprovedAdmins" line while keeping the JSON object hierarchy/structure intact
    ![Edit Number of Admins](../Images/07_OrgPolicy_Chg_Admin_Count.png) 

 iii) Save the file
 
 iv) Edit the ServerConfigMetadata.json file in the org-policy folder and create an entry for this file (if not already there)

![Entry in ServerConfigMetadata.json](../Images/07_OrgPolicy_Chg_SCMD_Entry.png) 

```JSON
{
    "OnlinePolicyList" : [
        {
            "Name" : "AzSdk.json"
        }, 
        {
            "Name" : "ControlSettings.json"
        }
    ]
}
```

 v) Rerun the policy setup command (the same command you ran for the first time setup)
 
###### Testing: 

Anyone in your org can now start a fresh PS console and the result of the evaluation of the number of owners/admins control in 
the subscription security scan (Get-AzSDKSubscriptionSecurityStatus) should reflect that the new setting is in 
effect. (E.g., if you changes the max count to 3 and they had 4 owners/admins in their subscription, then the control
result will change from 'Passed' to 'Failed'.)


##### c) Creating a custom control 'baseline' for your org
Note that a powerful capability of AzSDK is the ability for an org to define a baseline control set on the policy server
that can be leveraged by all individuals in the org (and in other AzSDK scenarios like CICD, CA, etc.) via the "-UseBaselineControls" parameter
during scan commands. 

By default, when someone runs against the CDN endpoint, the "-UseBaselineControls" parameter leverages the set of
controls listed as baseline in the ControlSettings.json file present on CDN. 

However, once you have set up an org policy server for your organization, the CDN endpoint is no more in use. (As a 
side note, you can always 'simulate' CDN-based/org-neutral execution by removing or renaming your 
`%localappdata%\Microsoft\AzSDK\AzSDKSettings.json` file.) Thus, after org policy is setup, there will 
not be a 'baseline' control set defined for your organization. Indeed, if you run any of the scan commands using the
"-UseBaselineControls" switch, you will see that the switch gets ignored and **all** controls for respective 
resources are evaluated. 

To support the baseline controls behavior for your org, you will need to define your baseline in the ControlSettings.json
file. Here are the steps...

###### Steps: 

(We will assume you have tried the max owner/admin count steps in (b) above and edit the ControlSettings.json 
file already present in your org policy folder.)

 i) Edit the ControlSettings.json file to add a 'BaselineControls' object as per below:
 
```JSON
{
   "NoOfApprovedAdmins": 1,
   "BaselineControls": {
      "ResourceTypeControlIdMappingList": [
         {
            "ResourceType": "AppService",
            "ControlIds": [
               "Azure_AppService_DP_Dont_Allow_HTTP_Access",
               "Azure_AppService_AuthN_Use_AAD_for_Client_AuthN"
            ]
         },
         {
            "ResourceType": "Storage",
            "ControlIds": [
               "Azure_Storage_AuthN_Dont_Allow_Anonymous",
               "Azure_Storage_Deploy_Use_Geo_Redundant"
            ]
         }
      ],
      "SubscriptionControlIdList": [
         "Azure_Subscription_AuthZ_Limit_Admin_Owner_Count",
         "Azure_Subscription_AuthZ_Dont_Use_NonAD_Identities",
         "Azure_Subscription_Config_Azure_Security_Center"
      ],
      "ExpiryInDays": 6,
      "SupportedSources": [ "CC" ]
   }
}
```

> Notice how, apart from the couple of extra elements at the end, the baseline set is pretty much a list of 'ResourceType'
and 'ControlIds' for that resource...making it fairly easy to customize/tweak your own org baseline. 
> Here the name and casing of the resource type name must match that of the policy JSON file for the corresponding 
> resource's JSON file in the SVT folder and the control ids must match those included in the JSON file. 

> Note: Here we have used a very simple baseline with just a couple of resource types and a very small control set.
> A more realitic baseline control set will be more expansive. 
> <!-- TODO - add CDN-baseline pointer --> 
    
 ii) Save the ControlSettings.json file
 
 iii) Confirm that an entry for ControlSettings.json is already there in the ServerConfigMetadata.json file. (Else see step-iii in (c) above.)
 
 iv) Run the policy setup command (the same command you ran for the first time setup)

###### Testing:

To test that the baseline controls set is in effect, anyone in your org can start a fresh PS console and run the subscription
and resources security cmdlets with the `-UseBaselineControls` parameter. You will see that regardless of the actual
types of Azure resources present in their subscriptions, only the ones mentioned in the baseline get evaluated in the scan
and, even for those, only the baseline controls get evaluated.


##### d) Customizing specific controls for a service 

In this example, we will make a slightly more involved change in the context of a specific SVT (Storage). 

Imagine that you want to turn off the evaluation of some control altogether (regardless of whether people use the `-UseBaselineControls` parameter or not).
Also, for another control, you want people to use a recommendation which leverages an internal tool the security team
in your org has developed. Let us do this for the Storage.json file. Specifically, we will turn off the evaluation
of `Azure_Storage_Audit_Issue_Alert_AuthN_Req` altogether. We will modify severity of 
`Azure_Storage_AuthN_Dont_Allow_Anonymous` to `Critical` for our org (it is `High` by default) and
we will change the recommendation people in our org will follow if they need to address an issue with 
the `Azure_Storage_Deploy_Use_Geo_Redundant` control.

###### Steps: 
 
 i) Copy the Storage.json from the AzSDK installation to your org-policy folder

 ii) Remove everything except the ControlID, the Id and the specific property we want to modify as discussed above. 

 iii) Make changes to the properties of the respective controls so that the final JSON looks like the below. 

```JSON
{
  "Controls": [
   {
      "ControlID": "Azure_Storage_AuthN_Dont_Allow_Anonymous",
      "Id": "AzureStorage110",
      "ControlSeverity": "Critical"
   },
   {
      "ControlID": "Azure_Storage_Audit_Issue_Alert_AuthN_Req",
      "Id": "AzureStorage120",
      "Enabled": false
   },
   {
      "ControlID": "Azure_Storage_Deploy_Use_Geo_Redundant",
      "Id": "AzureStorage130",
      "Recommendation": "**Note**: Use our Contoso-IT-EnableGRS.ps1 tool for this!"
   }
  ]
}
```
> Note: The 'Id' field is used for identifying the control for policy merging. We are keeping the 'ControlId'
> field only because of the readability.

 iii) Save the file

 iv) Edit the ServerConfigMetadata.json file in the org-policy folder and create an entry for this file (if not already there)

 It should look something like the below:
```JSON
{
    "OnlinePolicyList" : [
        {
            "Name" : "AzSdk.json"
        }, 
        {
            "Name" : "ControlSettings.json"
        }, 
        {
            "Name" : "Storage.json"
        }
    ]
}
```  

 v) Rerun the org policy setup command (the same command you ran for the first time setup)
 
###### Testing: 
Someone in your org can test this change using the `Get-AzSDKAzureServicesSecurityStatus` command on a target
resource group which contains a storage account. If run with the `-UseBaselineControls` switch, you will see that
the anonymous access control shows as `Critical` in the output CSV and the GRS control recommendation has changed to
the custom (internal tool) recommendation you wanted people in your org to follow. The image below shows the CSV file
from a baseline scan after this change: 

![Changed Storage controls - Baseline Scan](../Images/07_OrgPolicy_Chg_SVT_JSON.png) 

Likewise, if you run without the `-UseBaselineControls` parameter, you will see that the anon-alert control does not get evaluated and does not
appear in the resulting CSV file. 


## Next Steps:

Once your org policy is setup, all scenarios/use cases of AzSDK should work seamlessly with your org policy server
as the policy endpoint for your org (instead of the default CDN endpoint). Basically, you should be able to do one 
or more of the following using AzSDK:

 - People will be able to install AzSDK using your special org-specific installer (the 'iwr' install command)
 - Developers will be able to run manual scans for security of their subscriptions and resources (GRS, GSS commands)
 - (Coming soon) Teams will be able to configure the AzSDK SVT release task in their CICD pipelines
 - Subscription owners will be able to setup Continuous Assurance (CA) from their local machines (**after** they've installed
 AzSDK using your org-specific 'iwr' installer locally)
 - Monitoring teams will be able to setup AzSDK OMS view and see scan results from CA (and also manual scans and CICD if configured) 
 - You will be able to do central governance for your org by leveraging telemetry events that will collect in the master subscription
 from all the AzSDK activity across your org. 

## Testing and troubleshooting org policy

#### Testing the overall policy setup
The policy setup command is fairly lightweight - both in terms of effort/time and in terms of costs incurred. We recommend that
you set up a 'Staging' environment where you can do all pre-testing of policy setup, policy changes, etc. A limited number of 
people could be engaged for testing the actual end user effects of changes before deploying them broadly. 
Also, you can choose to retain the staging setup or just re-create a fresh one for each major policy change.

For your actual (production) policies, we recommend that you check them into source control and use the local close of *that* folder as the location
for the AzSDK org policy setup command when uploading to the policy server. In fact, setting things up so that any policy
modifications are pushed to the policy server via a CICD pipeline would be ideal. (That is how we do it at CSE.)

	
#### Troubleshooting common issues 
Here are a few common things that may cause glitches and you should be careful about:

- Make sure you use exact case for file names for various policy files (and the names must match case-and-all
with the entries in the ServerConfigMetadata.json file)
- Make sure that no special/BOM characters get introduced into the policy file text. (The policy upload code does scrub for
a few known cases but we may have missed the odd one.)
- Don't forget to make entries in ServerConfigMetadata.json for all files you have changed.
- Note that the policy upload command always generates a fresh installer.ps1 file for upload. If you want to make changes to 
that, you may have to keep a separate copy and upload it. (We will revisit this in future sprints.)
